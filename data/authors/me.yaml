# BIO BREVE (Per la sidebar/widget)

bio: |

  Stefano Blando is a PhD Researcher within the National PhD Program in Artificial Intelligence (AI for Society), based at the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and the University of Pisa.

  His research bridges the gap between Economic Theory and Data-Driven AI. Building on a solid multi-disciplinary foundation in Economics & Finance, Statistics, and Machine Learning, he focuses on the rigorous validation of complex systems.

  His goal is to overcome the limitations of static equilibrium models by applying advanced computational frameworks to socio-economic dynamics.
