# Bio breve per i widget (sidebar)
bio: |
 Stefano Blando is a PhD Researcher within the National PhD Program in AI (SSSA & UniPi), bridging the gap between Economic Theory and Data-Driven AI.
  
  Building on a multi-disciplinary foundation in Economics, Statistics, and Machine Learning, he focuses on the rigorous validation of complex systems using High-Performance Computing (HPC).
  
  His goal is to overcome the limitations of static equilibrium models by applying Automated Parameter Calibration, Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to map uncertainty in non-ergodic socio-economic environments.
