## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence** at the **Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna** and the **University of Pisa**.

My research integrates **Computational Economics**, **Network Science**, and **Advanced Statistics** to model and validate complex financial systems. I adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to bridge the gap between economic theory and data-driven AI.

### 🧰 Methodological Toolkit

My general expertise covers the full pipeline of modeling and analysis:

* **Complex Systems & Simulation:** Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Stochastic Simulations, and Complex Network Theory.
* **Machine & Deep Learning:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Learning architectures, and Reinforcement Learning.
* **Advanced Statistics:** High-Dimensional Statistics, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Statistical Model Checking (SMC).

### 🔭 Current Research Focus

Currently, I am focused on the **rigorous validation of Complex Dynamical Stochastic Systems**, moving beyond standard equilibrium analysis. My work specifically employs:

* **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) & ABC:** For the automated parameter calibration of black-box simulation models without tractable likelihoods.
* **Ensemble Analysis:** To characterize **non-ergodic** behaviors and map uncertainty where time averages differ from ensemble averages.
* **Functional Data Analysis (FDA):** Applied to the study of **Statistical Transients** and trajectory clustering in high-dimensional systems.
