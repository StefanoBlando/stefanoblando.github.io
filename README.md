## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence** at the **Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna** and the **University of Pisa**.

My research lies at the intersection of **Computational Economics**, **Network Science**, and **Advanced Statistics**. I specialize in modeling complex systems using a multi-disciplinary toolkit that includes **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, **MCMC methods**, **Functional Statistics**, and **Deep Learning**.

### 🔭 Current Research Focus

My research lies at the intersection of **Computational Economics**, **Network Science**, and **Advanced Statistics**. I specialize in the rigorous validation of complex systems using a multi-disciplinary toolkit that includes:

* **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) & ABC:** For the automated parameter calibration of black-box simulation models.
* **Statistical Model Checking:** To verify properties of stochastic systems ensuring robustness and reliability.
* **Functional Data Analysis (FDA):** Applied to the study of transient dynamics and trajectory clustering.
* **Ensemble Analysis:** To characterize non-ergodic behaviors and map uncertainty beyond standard equilibrium metrics.
