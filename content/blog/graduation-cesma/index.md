I am proud to announce that on **Monday, February 2nd, 2026**, I will be awarded the **II Level Master in Customer Experience, Statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (CESMA)** at the **University of Rome Tor Vergata**.
.

### The Thesis

My thesis, titled **"Network Topology and Machine Learning for Systemic Risk: From Early Warning to Trading Strategies"**, explores the application of Graph Neural Networks and complex network theory to identify early warning signals in financial markets.

This work is directly connected to my ongoing research. You can explore the technical details and the code in the dedicated sections of this portfolio:

* 👉 **[View the Research Project](/projects/network-crash-prediction/)** * 📄 **[Read the Related Paper](/publications/network-crash-prediction/)** The master provided a strong foundation in advanced statistical methods and AI, which I am now applying to my PhD research at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.
