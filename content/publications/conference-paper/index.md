abstract: "This thesis addresses the challenge of portfolio optimization in high-dimensional settings (p > n) affected by sparse contamination (outliers). By proposing a robust Factor-Analytic approach, the study demonstrates how to stabilize covariance matrix estimation against data anomalies. The resulting allocation strategies exhibit superior resilience and risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional Mean-Variance frameworks, especially during market shocks."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "A robust statistical framework for optimizing high-dimensional portfolios in the presence of market outliers."
