abstract: "To distinguish genuine findings from methodological artifacts, this paper proposes a validation framework based on method-invariant patterns. Analyzing 999,152 multilingual reviews across 18 independent techniques (from classical clustering to Transformers), we demonstrate that substantive content accounts for 95.4% of variance, while methodological choice explains less than 3%. The study confirms that robust patterns transcend specific algorithms and implementations. Furthermore, while BERT achieves peak accuracy (91.3%), classical approaches like SVM offer comparable performance (89.1%) with a 29-fold reduction in computational cost."
# Summary.
