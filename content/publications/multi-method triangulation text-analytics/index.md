abstract: "This paper introduces a robust methodological framework for validating text analytics results on large-scale unstructured datasets. By applying a 'triangulation' strategy on a corpus of over 1 million multilingual texts, the study compares and validates 18 distinct analytical approaches. The framework integrates traditional statistical methods with state-of-the-art Deep Learning models (including BERT, LDA, and Graph Neural Networks) to ensure cross-platform stability and reduce algorithmic bias in sentiment and semantic extraction."

# Summary.
summary: "A methodological framework validating 18 analytical approaches (BERT, LDA, GNN) on 1M+ texts to ensure cross-platform stability."
