abstract: "This research presents a novel framework for predicting financial market crashes and volatility spillovers by combining Dynamic Correlation Networks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, the study employs the GraphSAGE architecture to learn inductive node embeddings from the evolving market topology. By capturing non-linear dependencies and topological shifts in the asset correlation network, the model aims to identify precursors of systemic risk events earlier and more accurately than traditional econometric indicators."

This work represents a methodological application of **Graph Neural Networks** to financial time series, derived from my Master Thesis research.
